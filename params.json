{"name":"Cage","tagline":"cmf built on python 3, tornado, and mongodb","body":"# cage\r\n\r\ncontent management framework built on python 3, tornado, and\r\nmongo. this is the RESTful backend and is not intended to be exposed\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\n## idea behind this?\r\n\r\nwell, I wanted something that handles different entity types\r\nindividual of each other. for example, I wanted to query for a\r\n`activity` entity type that would provide me access to a `status`\r\nattribute that could be manipulated by a frontend application anyway I\r\nsee fit. Kind of like Drupal's custom field attributes, or Wordpress'\r\ncustom advanced fields. Obviously, with a smaller footprint and\r\nentities encoded in json so I could easily write any frontend I wanted\r\nas long as it knew what json was. Im sure this has been done million\r\ntimes over but I was bored.\r\n\r\nsome things I want to implement:\r\n\r\n* entity constraints\r\n* mongo's replication features\r\n* entity helpers/validators\r\n\r\nsome things that shouldnt be here:\r\n\r\n* authentication - its not intended to be public\r\n* entity dependencies on each other\r\n* a bear\r\n\r\n## requirements\r\n\r\npython >= 3.3.2, mongo, <3\r\n\r\n## installation\r\n\r\n\tgit clone git@github.com:battlemidget/cage.git\r\n\tcd cage\r\n\tpip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\n## Run in debug mode (autoreload enabled)\r\n\r\n\t./claw --debug\r\n\r\nSingle instance, increased logging, and autoreload during changes.\r\n\r\n## Run in production\r\n\r\n    ./claw\r\n\r\nThis will run multiple instances equal to your num of cpus. Autoreload\r\nis not available in this mode.\r\n\r\n## viewing\r\n\r\nThere's really nothing to \"view\" in a browser, but the default port is\r\n`9000` so you could visit `http://localhost:9000` if you're feeling\r\nsquirrely.\r\n\r\n## deploy\r\n\r\nI like nginx so use that with proxy_pass, look in\r\n`scripts/deploy-post` for an example. Or you're own proxy server\r\nthat'll handle a cluster of cage instances.\r\n\r\n# copyright\r\n\r\n(c) 2011-2013 Adam Stokes\r\n\r\n# license\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
